# SimpleTaskCenter
A small Electron app that integrates with the ZolaSuite web API to make handling task lists easier and richer.

Still very much in development. Made for my own personal use, but I've left it public so other people can use it too if they want.

To Zola/Abacus - I'm honestly not sure what the rules/restrictions are around making apps that integrate with the API found at https://secure.zolasuite.com/api2/metadata, as I have not found any documentation or statements released by the company regarding its use. However, the metadata page lists it as the "Zola Public API", so I am assuming its use is okay. If that is not the case, please just let me know and I'll be happy to take this down.
